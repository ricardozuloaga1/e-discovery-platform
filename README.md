- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automatic summarization, PII detection, and entity extraction
- **Document Viewer**: Review documents with advanced redaction capabilities
- **Tagging System**: Organize documents with custom tags and categories
- **Production Tools**: Generate production sets with Bates stamping

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI for document analysis and insights
- **Document Processing**: Support for PDF, DOCX, and plain text formats

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ricardozuloaga1/e-discovery-platform.git
   cd e-discovery-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   - Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

4. Initialize the database schema
   ```
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Upload Documents**: Use the upload feature to add documents to the system
2. **Review Documents**: Open documents in the viewer to read and analyze content
3. **Apply Redactions**: Use the redaction tools to hide sensitive information
4. **Create Productions**: Generate production sets with Bates numbering

## Review Protocol API

Manage review protocols and use AI to suggest coding decisions.

### Upload a Protocol

Send a `POST` request to `/api/protocols` with JSON describing the protocol:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/protocols \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Default","instructions":"How to code","codes":["Responsive","Privileged"]}'
```

### Fetch or Delete Protocols

- `GET /api/protocols` – list all protocols
- `GET /api/protocols/:id` – retrieve a specific protocol
- `DELETE /api/protocols/:id` – remove a protocol

### AI Coding Suggestions

Request coding suggestions for a document by sending its text to `/api/ai/suggest-coding`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/suggest-coding \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Document text to analyze"}'
```

The response contains the recommended codes based on the active protocol.
